A child living in a book desert, with limited access to books, may not have the opportunity to develop the skills to become an engaged reader. Unfortunately, book deserts are often a reality for families living in low-income communities. In fact, some of the lowest-income neighborhoods in the country report having one available book for every 300 children. Below are three ways you can increase access to books for communities who need them most. All of these volunteer initiatives not only bring books to communities in need, but can strengthen community relationships, and build new partnerships.",
