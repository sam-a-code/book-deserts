# ðŸ“š Book Deserts + Resources

My partner and I built this project as part of our software engineering bootcamp. The goal of this project is to raise awareness about what book deserts are, as well as to highlight organizations and resources that are trying to improve them. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ðŸ“– Installing our book desert site
#### `npm install`

## ðŸ““ Using our book desert site

In the project directory, first run:
#### `npm run seed`

Then, you can run:

#### `npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

When you make changes the page will reload automatically. You may also see lint errors in the console.
